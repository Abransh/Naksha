npm run health-check        # Check API health endpoint
npm run security:scan       # Run npm audit for security issues
npm run performance:test    # Load test with autocannon

# Internal Testing Commands (for debugging issues)
# Run these if you encounter problems:
cd packages/database && npm run db:generate  # Regenerate Prisma client
cd apps/api && npm run type-check            # Check TypeScript errors
cd apps/api && npm run build                # Test compilation
cd apps/api && npm run health-check         # Test server health
cd apps/api && npm run db:studio            # Open database GUI
```

### Dashboard Commands (`apps/dashboard`)
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start Next.js dev server with Turbopack
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start              # Start production server
npm run lint               # ESLint check
```

### Database Package Commands (`packages/database`)
```bash
npm run db:generate        # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push           # Push schema to database
npm run db:studio         # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:reset          # Reset database
npm run db:migrate        # Run migrations
npm run db:seed           # Seed database
```

## Key Configuration Files

- **Database Schema**: `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema with all models
- **API Entry Point**: `apps/api/src/index.ts` - Main server setup with middleware and routing
- **Environment**: API uses standard `.env` file for configuration
- **TypeScript**: Both apps use TypeScript with strict configuration

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and initialize database
2. **Development**: Use `npm run dev` to start both API and dashboard concurrently
3. **Database Changes**: Modify schema in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`, then run `npm run db:push`
4. **Testing**: API includes comprehensive test setup with Jest, Supertest, and Newman
5. **Code Quality**: Both lint and type-check commands available for code quality assurance

## Important Implementation Notes

### **Critical Business Logic**
- **Admin Approval Required**: Consultants can signup/login but cannot access dashboard until admin approves
- **JWT Authentication**: Separate auth systems for consultants vs admins
- **Email Verification**: Required for all new consultant signups
- **Redis Caching**: Used for sessions, rate limiting, and temporary data
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged with winston logger

### **Security Features**
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- JWT with refresh tokens and secure cookie handling
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Helmet security headers

### **Database Design**
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Complete schema with all business entities
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Optimized indexes for performance
- Analytics tables for reporting

### **Development Workflow**
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo
- Shared packages for database, types, utilities
- TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error classes

## Key Architectural Decisions Implemented

### 1. **Monorepo Structure with Turborepo**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Shared packages for common functionality
- Efficient build and deployment pipeline

### 2. **API-First Architecture**
- RESTful API with versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- Separate authentication for consultants and admins
- Comprehensive middleware stack

### 3. **Database Strategy**
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Complete schema implementation from day 1
- Optimized queries with proper indexing

### 4. **Security-First Approach**
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and CORS protection

### 5. **Scalability Considerations**
- Redis for caching and session management
- Background job processing
- File upload optimization
- Database query optimization

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1 Implementation Order:
1. **Database Setup** (`apps/api/prisma/`)
2. **Core Authentication** (`apps/api/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`)
3. **Consultant Management** (`apps/api/src/controllers/consultant.controller.ts`)
4. **Dashboard Backend** (`apps/api/src/controllers/dashboard.controller.ts`)
5. **Settings Management** (Complete profile setup)

### Phase 2 Implementation:
1. **Session Management** (`apps/api/src/controllers/session.controller.ts`)
2. **Payment Integration** (`apps/api/src/controllers/payment.controller.ts`)
3. **Email Automation** (`apps/api/src/services/email.service.ts`)

### Phase 3 Implementation:
1. **Analytics & Reports** (`apps/api/src/services/analytics.service.ts`)
2. **Quotation System** (`apps/api/src/controllers/quotation.controller.ts`)
3. **Advanced Dashboard Features**

## Next Steps

Ready to start implementing the backend! Let's begin with:

1. **Database Schema Setup** - Complete Prisma schema
2. **Core API Structure** - Express app setup with middleware
3. **Authentication System** - JWT with admin approval logic
4. **Consultant Management** - CRUD operations with admin approval
