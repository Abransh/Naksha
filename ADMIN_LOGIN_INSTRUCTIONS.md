# Nakksha Admin Login Instructions

## How to Login as Admin

### 1. Create Default Admin User

First, you need to create a default admin user in the database:

```bash
# Navigate to the database package
cd packages/database

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run the admin seeder script to create default admin
npm run admin:seed
```

This will create a default admin user with the following credentials:
- **Email**: `admin@nakksha.in`
- **Password**: `Admin@123!`
- **Role**: `SUPER_ADMIN`

### 2. Access Admin Login Page

Navigate to the admin login page in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/login
```

### 3. Login with Admin Credentials

Use the credentials created by the seeder:
- **Email**: `admin@nakksha.in`
- **Password**: `Admin@123!`

### 4. Access Admin Dashboard

After successful login, you'll be redirected to the admin dashboard at:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```
