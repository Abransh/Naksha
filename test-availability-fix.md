# Availability System Fix Testing Guide

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. **API Endpoint Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Frontend was calling `/sessions/book` but backend provided `/book`
- **Fix**: Updated `api.ts` to use correct endpoint `/api/v1/book`
- **Impact**: Session booking will now reach the correct endpoint

### 2. **Booking Validation Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Backend required date/time but frontend allows manual booking without time
- **Fix**: Made `selectedDate` and `selectedTime` optional in booking schema
- **Impact**: Manual booking (without specific time) now works

### 3. **Availability Modal Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Modal forced 1-hour increments, preventing multi-hour availability blocks
- **Fix**: Removed automatic endTime calculation, default to 9am-5pm range
- **Impact**: Consultants can now create 8-hour availability blocks (9am-5pm)

### 4. **Slot Generation Logic Fix** ✅  
- **Issue**: Backend created only 1 slot per pattern instead of hourly slots
- **Fix**: Modified slot generation to create individual 1-hour slots from time ranges
- **Impact**: 9am-5pm pattern now generates 8 slots: 9-10am, 10-11am, ..., 4-5pm

### 5. **Availability Slot Booking Integration** ✅
- **Issue**: Booking didn't mark availability slots as reserved
- **Fix**: Added slot reservation logic in booking transaction
- **Impact**: Booked slots are now marked as unavailable for future bookings

### 6. **Cache Invalidation Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Frontend cached stale availability data
- **Fix**: Added proper cache clearing when slots are generated or booked
- **Impact**: Frontend shows real-time availability updates

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Consultant Experience:
1. **Create Availability**: Set 9am-5pm availability for Monday (Personal Sessions)
2. **Slot Generation**: System creates 8 individual hourly slots automatically
3. **View Results**: Consultant sees all 8 time slots available for booking

### Client Experience:
1. **View Availability**: See all 8 available time slots for Monday
2. **Book Session**: Select specific hour (e.g., 2pm-3pm) and book
3. **Slot Reservation**: That specific slot becomes unavailable for others
4. **Manual Booking**: Can also book without specific time for consultant to schedule later

### System Integration:
1. **Real-time Updates**: Availability changes reflected immediately across all components
2. **Cache Management**: No stale data issues with availability
3. **Database Consistency**: Availability slots properly linked to bookings

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Availability Creation
```
1. Go to consultant dashboard
2. Click "Set Availability" 
3. Add time slot: Monday 9:00am - 5:00pm (Personal Sessions)
4. Save schedule
5. Verify backend generates 8 individual slots (check API response)
```

### 2. Test Slot Display  
```
1. Go to consultant showcase page
2. Click "Book Personal Session"
3. Select date (Monday)
4. Verify 8 time options appear: 9:00am-10:00am, 10:00am-11:00am, etc.
```

### 3. Test Booking Integration
```
1. Book a session for 2:00pm-3:00pm
2. Verify booking completes successfully
3. Check that 2:00pm-3:00pm slot is no longer available for booking
4. Verify other slots (1:00pm-2:00pm, 3:00pm-4:00pm) remain available
```

### 4. Test Manual Booking
```
1. Book a session without selecting specific time
2. Leave date/time empty and proceed
3. Verify booking creates session with "To be scheduled" status
4. Confirm consultant receives manual scheduling request
```

## Key Files Modified

- `/apps/consultant-dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` - Fixed booking endpoint

## Expected Results

- **Before Fix**: Only 1 availability slot shown regardless of time range

- **Before Fix**: Booking failures due to API endpoint mismatch  
- **After Fix**: Successful booking with proper slot reservation
