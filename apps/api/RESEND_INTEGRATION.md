# Resend API Integration for Quotation Management

## Overview
Successfully integrated **Resend API** for reliable and professional quotation email delivery. This replaces the previous SMTP-based email system with a modern, cloud-based email service.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Professional Email Templates**
- **Client Quotation Email**: Beautiful, responsive HTML template with quotation details
- **Consultant Confirmation Email**: Clean confirmation template for consultants
- **Mobile-responsive design** with professional styling
- **Branded templates** with consistent visual identity

### 2. **Resend Service Integration** (`src/services/resendEmailService.ts`)
- **Full Resend API integration** with TypeScript types
- **Parallel email sending** (client + consultant emails)
- **Email delivery tracking** with Resend email IDs
- **Professional error handling** and retry logic
- **Database logging** for email audit trail

### 3. **Enhanced Quotation API** (`src/routes/v1/quotations.ts`)
- **Updated send endpoint** to use Resend instead of SMTP
- **Improved error handling** with detailed email status
- **Better response data** including email IDs from Resend
- **Graceful fallback** - continues if consultant email fails

### Email Analytics & Tracking

  type: "quotation_shared",    // Email template type
  recipient: "client@email.com",
  status: "SENT",              // Delivery status
  sentAt: "2025-07-03T..."     // Timestamp
}
```

## 📋 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Resend integration
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_resend_api_key_here"
EMAIL_FROM="Naksha Platform <noreply@naksha.com>"
EMAIL_REPLY_TO="support@naksha.com"
FRONTEND_URL="https://dashboard.naksha.com"
```

### Getting Resend API Key
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Verify your domain (e.g., naksha.com)
3. Create API key in dashboard
4. Add to environment variables

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Email Sending Flow
```typescript
// 1. Quotation send request
POST /api/v1/quotations/{id}/send

// 2. Prepare email data
const emailData = {
  quotationId, quotationName, clientEmail,
  consultantName, finalAmount, etc.
};

// 3. Send via Resend API (parallel)
const results = await sendQuotationEmails(emailData);

// 4. Update quotation status
quotation.status = 'SENT';
quotation.sentAt = new Date();

// 5. Return success with email IDs
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Graceful error handling at multiple levels
try {
  const emailResults = await sendQuotationEmails(data);
  
  // Client email is critical - fail if it doesn't send
  if (!emailResults.client.success) {
    throw new AppError('Failed to send to client');
  }
  
  // Consultant email is optional - warn but continue
  if (!emailResults.consultant.success) {
    console.warn('Consultant email failed:', error);
  }
  
} catch (error) {
  // Detailed error logging and user feedback
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. **Test Quotation Creation & Send**
```bash
# 1. Create quotation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/quotations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "quotationName": "Website Development",
    "clientName": "John Doe",
    "clientEmail": "john@example.com",
    "baseAmount": 50000,
    "discountPercentage": 10
  }'

# 2. Send quotation (using returned CUID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/quotations/QUOTATION_ID/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "emailMessage": "Please review this quotation",
    "includeAttachment": false
  }'
```

### 2. **Verify Email Delivery**
- Check client's inbox for professional quotation email
- Check consultant's inbox for confirmation email
- Verify email logs in database
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Application Logs
```bash
# Watch for email sending logs
📧 Sending quotation emails via Resend for quotation: cmco1yrjk...
✅ Quotation emails sent successfully: {
  client: true,
  consultant: true,
  clientEmailId: "re_abc123",
  consultantEmailId: "re_def456"
}
```

### Database Email Logs
```sql
-- Check email delivery status
SELECT * FROM email_logs 
WHERE email_type IN ('quotation_shared', 'quotation_confirmation')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check for failed emails
SELECT * FROM email_logs 
WHERE status = 'FAILED' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Resend Dashboard
- Monitor email delivery rates
- View bounce and complaint reports
- Track email open rates (if configured)
- Analyze sending reputation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. "RESEND_API_KEY not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Add to environment variables
export RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_key_here"
```

**2. "Invalid from address"**
```bash
# Solution: Verify domain in Resend dashboard
EMAIL_FROM="Naksha Platform <noreply@your-verified-domain.com>"
```

**3. "Email delivery failed"**
```bash
# Check logs for specific error message
# Common causes: Invalid recipient, domain not verified, API limits
```

**4. "Client email sent but consultant email failed"**
```bash
# This is handled gracefully - quotation is still marked as sent
# Check consultant email address validity
```
